 The fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes using Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, functionalized with either aniline or 4-nitroaniline diazonium, and their assembly with a 3M KOH electrolyte. Nickel foam is coated with nanoparticle paste and dried to enhance electrochemical properties. The device is tested via LED discharge.

**1. Electrode Preparation Using Fe₃O₄ Nanoparticles**

To fabricate supercapacitor electrodes using Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, begin by cutting nickel foam into pieces of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm. Clean the foam by sonicating it in diluted HCl to remove surface impurities, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water under sonication to eliminate any residual acid. After cleaning, dry the nickel foam in an oven at 60°C for 7 hours. Prepare a paste by mixing Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, carbon black, and a PVDF solution (prepared in N-Methylpyrrolidone) in an 8:1:1 ratio. Apply 1.5–2.5 mg of this paste evenly onto each piece of nickel foam. Finally, dry the coated electrodes in an oven at 60°C for another 7 hours. This results in high-performance electrodes using pure Fe₃O₄ as the active material.

**2. Electrode Preparation Using Fe₃O₄ Functionalized with Aniline Diazonium**

For electrodes utilizing Fe₃O₄ functionalized with aniline diazonium, begin by preparing the nickel foam in the same manner: cut, clean with diluted HCl under sonication, rinse with distilled water, and dry at 60°C for 7 hours. Surface-functionalize the Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with aniline diazonium to enhance their electrochemical properties. Mix the functionalized Fe₃O₄ with carbon black and PVDF in an 8:1:1 ratio to create a uniform paste. Apply 1.5–2.5 mg of this paste onto the nickel foam, ensuring even distribution. Dry the coated electrodes in an oven at 60°C for 7 hours. The functionalized material improves conductivity and electrochemical performance, making these electrodes suitable for high-capacity supercapacitors.

**3. Electrode Preparation Using Fe₃O₄ Functionalized with 4-Nitroaniline Diazonium**

For the fabrication of electrodes using Fe₃O₄ functionalized with 4-nitroaniline diazonium, follow the same initial steps for nickel foam preparation: cut, clean with diluted HCl, rinse with distilled water under sonication, and dry in an oven at 60°C for 7 hours. Surface-functionalize the Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles with 4-nitroaniline diazonium to enhance their redox activity and structural properties. Mix the functionalized Fe₃O₄ with carbon black and PVDF in an 8:1:1 ratio to prepare the paste. Apply a uniform 1.5–2.5 mg layer of this paste onto the nickel foam. After coating, dry the electrodes in an oven at 60°C for 7 hours. These electrodes demonstrate improved redox activity and long-term stability, ideal for advanced energy storage applications.

**4. Supercapacitor Device Assembly**

To assemble the supercapacitor device, take two prepared electrodes and place a piece of filter paper between them to act as a separator. The filter paper should be soaked in a 3M KOH electrolyte solution to ensure efficient ionic conduction. Align the electrodes with the separator, ensuring good contact. Connect the electrodes in parallel for a single unit. To enhance the overall performance, create three such units and connect them in series. Charge the assembled device by applying a potential difference for 60 seconds using the 3M KOH electrolyte. For testing, discharge the device by connecting it to an LED and record the glow time to evaluate the supercapacitor's performance.
